# Gmail Notification Setup

This document explains how to set up Gmail notifications for the VIX calculator.

## Prerequisites

1. A Google Cloud Project with Gmail API enabled
2. OAuth 2.0 credentials configured for a desktop application

## Setup Steps

1. Create Google Cloud Project:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
   - Create a new project or select existing project
   - Enable the Gmail API for your project

2. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials:
   - In Google Cloud Console, go to "APIs & Services" → "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" → "OAuth client ID"
   - Select "Desktop app" as application type
   - Download the client configuration file

3. Configure the application:
   - Rename downloaded file to `client_secret.json`
   - Place it in your home directory: `/home/your-username/client_secret.json`
   - Update the path in `alert_handler.py` if different

4. Generate token:
   ```bash
   python alert_handler.py --subject "Test" --body "Testing alerts"
   ```
   - This will open a browser for OAuth authorization
   - After authorization, `token.json` will be created

## Security Notes

- Never commit `token.json` or `client_secret.json` to version control
- These files contain sensitive credentials
- Both files are listed in `.gitignore`
- Each deployment needs its own token generation
